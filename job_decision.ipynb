However, if you're still at your curent position on `vestment_date - 90 days`, then thereafter seek new employment (to start after vestment) somewhere other than the UT state government with effort level `cur_pre_v_non_ut_effort_level_b`. \n",

In other words, don't start new employment until you reach the year mark.  Nevertheless, actively seek new Utah state government employment before `vestment_date - 100 days` if your subjective probability of being laid off before the year mark rises higher than 50%.  In any case, maintain whatever new employment is found until retirement on `retirement_date`.\n",
